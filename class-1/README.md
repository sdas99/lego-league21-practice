## Why learn Coding?
Whether you want to prepare for the future or just looking for a cool hobby, coding is a good skill to have in your tool kit. And remember, anyone can learn how to code!

## What is Coding?
Coding, sometimes called computer programming, is how we communicate with computers. Code tells a computer what actions to take, and writing code is like creating a set of instructions. By learning to write code, you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way. You can use this skill to make websites and apps, process data, and do lots of other cool things.
