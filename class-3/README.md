# Coding Assignments for Class-3
Objective: Get familiar with variables and my blocks and get ready to use them for Robot Game Missions.

## Assignment-1
Create two My Blocks: 

### Turn(angle) 
This will make the bot turn to the angle specified. 
Example:
* Turn(90) Turn to the right 90 degrees
* Turn(45) Turn to the right 45 degrees
* Turn(-45) Turn to the left 45 degrees
 
### Move(angle, distance) 
This will make the bot move at a specified angle for the specified distance
Example:
* Move(45, 10) Move forward 10 cm at 45 degree angle right of current position
* Move(-45, -10) Move back 10 cm at 45 degree angle left of current position

Hint: Use the Yaw angle to correct the turn angle

## Assignment-2
Use the my blocks created in Assigment #1 to:

### Move the bot in a Sqaure of side length 35

### Move the bot in a Equilateral triangle of legth 20
